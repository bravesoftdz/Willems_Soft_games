 Puzzle Shuffle Help 
---------------------

1. Load a bitmap (BMP) file using File -> load or 
   pressing the load button.
2. Choose File -> Shuffle or Press the shuffle 
   button to shuffle the puzzle
3. The aim of the game is to move pieces to the
   empty (white) spot so that you get the whole
   image back as you can see in the preview.
4. You move a piece to the empty (white) spot
   by Clicking on a piece that lays above, under
   left or right from the empty(white piece).
5. Keep on doing this till you have the puzzle
   solved

Note: The puzzle isn't automaticly shuffled when 
      loaded for the main raison that you now can
      load a new image while actually playing the
      current puzzle. So if it gets to hard you can
      load a simpler image :)
